# Telegram-ECommerce-NER

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for EthioMart, a centralized e-commerce platform in Ethiopia. The system will extract key business entities such as product names, prices, and locations from Amharic text, images, and documents shared across multiple Telegram channels.


## Business Need

EthioMart's vision is to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. By consolidating real-time data from multiple e-commerce Telegram channels, EthioMart aims to provide a seamless experience for customers to explore and interact with multiple vendors in one place.

## Key Objectives

1. Real-time data extraction from Telegram channels
2. Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for Amharic Named Entity Recognition
3. Extraction of entities such as Product names, Prices, and Locations

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main tasks:

1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
2. Data Labeling in CoNLL Format
3. Fine-tuning NER Models
4. Model Comparison and Selection
5. Model Interpretability
